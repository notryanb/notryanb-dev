      Keeping it <em>simple</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've always had difficulty maintaining a blog.
        My previous one is still available on github pages at 
        <a href="https://notryanb.github.io/" target="_blank">https://notryanb.github.io/</a>.
        So why make a new one?
        I reflect on this often and tried to figure out why it wasn't working.
      </p>

      <p> 
        Simplicity.
        I had previously been using Jekyll (Ruby) and then tried out Zola (Rust).
        In both cases my decreased motivation stemmed from not knowing the frameworks very well.
        I could've spent a lot of time learning how they work, but then im not writing.
        After stumbling upon this <a href="https://j3s.sh/thought/my-website-is-one-binary.html" target="_blank">article</a>,
        I decided I wanted to do something similar.
      </p>

      <p>
        My main motivation here is only use what I <em>need</em> 
        and pick up a few skills on the way.
        This blog is a single Rust binary.
        The current dependencies are hyper & tokio.
        There is no templating engine. I'm writing html and inlining the CSS.
        This will probably change in the future, but only as I need it.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the near future I anticipate writing articles on using Rust for audio.
        Some of the styling may become more advanced and maybe I'll even use a template engine like tera.
        I won't make any other promises yet, so I guess I'll see where this takes me.
